Howdy fellow Red Wings fans!

I am the maintainer of the little [Light the Lamp](https://www.lightthelamp.dev/about.html) app that some of y'all used throughout the season. I just wanted to thank all of you for using the site. I hope it brought a little joy to you and your friends and family. What's better than a little friendly competition and watching our Red Wings? That said: I am sad to say I did not crush you all, but I like to think I won first place in the light-the-lamp-app-creating category :') Below are your actual winners, with some fun bonus accolades to boot!

And I just wanted to let y'all know that I 100% plan on running this site for next season, too. The only plans I have for changes would include:
* A potential UI redesign (I still don't know what I'm doing, but maybe I can make it prettier)
* A 2 game timeout per-pick. e.g. you pick Larkin, can't pick him again until the third game after. (Let me know your thoughts on this one, it looks like the announcers are only able to pick a given player or the team about 25% of the time, so this might force folks to be more strategic with their picks)

If anyone has any feedback or improvement ideas, please let me know!

Thanks for a great season, LGRW.
